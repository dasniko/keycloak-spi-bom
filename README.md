# (Custom) Keycloak SPI BOM

As the official Keycloak SPI BOM is still lacking good and comprehensive dependency support, I maintain an own, custom Keycloak SPI BOM to use in Keycloak SPI extension projects.

You are free to use this BOM _as-is_, so there's no warranty that everything is properly set.
Versioning is aligned to Keycloak versions.
Just use the desired proper tag.

Currently, this BOM is only available via [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#dasniko/keycloak-spi-bom) repository.
